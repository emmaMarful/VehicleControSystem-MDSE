# VehicleControSystem-MDSE
This repository contains a Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDE) tool developed using Eclipse Sirius and EMF (Ecore) to design and validate Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) architectures. The tool allows users to architect sensor-actuator networks, specifically modeled after the Elegoo 37 Sensor Kit V2.0 for this project.
